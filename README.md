## James Dix

I'm a science graduate who is interested in technology and it's impact on humans and the world both historically, today and in the future. After University ended, I gained a position at a digital marketing agency which fulfilled by desire to work with technology in the business world. And whilst I gained invaluable skills during my 2 and a half years there, I hungered to be able to improve the tech; to move from a passive user to an active Maker.

I'm excited about a role where I can develop products that fundamentally impacts the way humans interact with each other - whether that's businesses interacting with businesses, businesses interacting with their users, or users interacting with other users. Personal development and progression is key, against a backdrop of a progressive company who aim to deliver best-in-class products.

## Skills

#### Communication

I fulfilled a client-facing role for 2 and a half years at my previous employer. As such I have developed excellent communication skills especially around technical topics which need to be communicated in non-technical terms. Externally, rhis encompassed performance reviews and sales meetings with C-Level executives at blue chip companies. Internally, I was responsible for a team of six Account Managers whom I had to organise in order to deliver excellent digital marketing campaigns for our clients.

#### Software Craftsmanship

I consider myself an 'all-rounder' full-stack developer and I can honestly say I enjoy the back-end and the front-end equally. Being verstalite in my tech skills allows me to touch products end-to-end and ensure outputted web applications work seamlessly. I'm a product-driven engineer and I constantly consider the end-user of the products on which I work to ensure the products are being developed for them, and not for the team building it.

I'm currently expanding my development arsenal by learning Java and React JS - both of which weren't taught on the Makers Academy course. I'm excited to employ my software crafstmanship skills at a company who create world-class products.

#### Analysis

Whilst operating as an Account Manager for my previous employer I fulfilled an Analyst role across many clients. Analysisng large sets of data and extracting valuable insights was the bread and butter of the job and one which I exceptionally enjoyed. I was also one of the champions of the product we used (DoubeClick) finding new ways of using the tech to improve the campaigns we were running - I wrote multiple blogs on getting the most out of the platform. I trained all new joiners on the platform as well as demo'd the product in sales meetings to prospective clients. My expertise on the platforms led to me winning various industry awards for campaign delivery and performance.
