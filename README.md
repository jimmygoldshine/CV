## James Dix

I'm a science graduate who is interested in technology and it's impact on humans and the world both historically, today and in the future. After University ended I gained a position at a digital marketing agency which fulfilled by desire to work with technology. And whilst I gained invaluable skills during my 2 and a half years there, I hungered to be able to improve the tech; to move from a passive user to an active Maker.

I'm excited about a role where I can develop products that fundamentally impacts the way humans interact with each other - whether that's businesses interacting with businesses, businesses interacting with their users, or users interacting with other users isn't a differentiating factor at this point. Personal development and progression is key, against a backdrop of a progressive company who aims to deliver best-in-class products.

## Skills

#### Communication

I fulfilled a client-facing role for 2 and a half years at my previous employer. As such I have developed excellent communication skills especially around technical topics which need to be communicated in non-technical terms. Externally, rhis encompassed performance reviews and sales meetings with C-Level executives at blue chip companies. Internally, I was responsible for a team of six Account Managers whom I had to organise in order to deliver excellent digital marketing campaigns for our clients.

#### Analysis

Whilst operating as an Account Manager for my previous employer I fulfilled an Analyst role across many clients. Analysisng large sets of data and extracting valuable insights was the bread and butter of the job and one which I exceptionally enjoyed. I was also one of the champions of the product we used (DoubeClick) finding new ways of using the tech to improve the campaigns we were running - I wrote multiple blogs on getting the most out of the platform. I trained all new joiners on the platform as well as demo'd the product in sales meetings to prospective clients. My expertise on the platforms led to me winning various industry awards for campaign delivery and performance.
